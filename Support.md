## Foreword

I try my best to help everyone but there are limits I crossed in the past *(working 60h/week or debugging in bed at 2 am)* that I'm not willing to cross again. Please remember that :

1. photography might be your hobby but it is my job, it might be your break from your job but it's not mine,
2. there is one of me and many of you,
3. I enjoy vacations and week-end as much as you do,
4. office hours are 10:00(am) – 19:00(pm), Paris local time (UTC+01 during winter and UTC+02 during summer).

## Getting support

1. Try to use public channels as much as possible (aka the bug tracker or discussions here), in order to leave archives that can be indexed by search engines and found again later to help other people,
2. Try to use search engines as much as possible because there are good chances that your problem already has a solution, for the aforementionned reason,
3. As a last resort, if your pictures are personal or sensitive and you don't want to post them on the internet, contact me in private by email at `contact [at] aurelienpierre [dot] com`.

If you need to send me heavy files, please use my private cloud and upload them on https://cloud.apmlt.net/s/YAdfYajPkE5nLyW with a meaningful name (mentionning your email or username here) and possible zipped. The upload limit is 4 GB. Please don't use third-party file sharing platforms that may delete the files after one week, there is no guaranty I will download them in time.
